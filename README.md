# epicluster

This repository contains a Python package that can be used to estimate changes in the time-varying reproduction number from time series of cases. The statistical model is from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics, and results from using this package are given in [Creswell et al., 2022, "A Bayesian nonparametric method for detecting rapid changes in disease transmission", Journal of Theoretical Biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519322003423).

## Installation

Local copies of the package files are installable via `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

See the examples directory for a simple notebook performing inference. 

The results repository (https://github.com/SABS-R3-Epidemiology/epicluster-results) contains multiple examples illustrating the full functionality of the package.
